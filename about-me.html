            <h3>Hello! I'm Julianne. </h3>
            <p>I'm originally from Virginia but I moved out to Oregon in 2020 to have more access to the outdoors. Growing up I spent my summers in Montana at my family's cabin and that's where my love of mountains began. Now living in Oregon, I take every opportunity I have to get outdoors, whether that's hiking to wildflower meadows in the Gorge, backpacking to alpine lakes in the summer, or biking around Portland just to enjoy a sunny day. </p>
